# Hydrogen Atom
To print the spectrum of a hydrogen atom in **Java**:

We can use the ***Rydberg*** formula to calculate the wavelengths of the spectral lines.</break>
Here's a simple implementation,to print the spectrum of a hydrogen atom in __Java__, <break>
we can use the ***Rydberg*** formula to calculate the wavelengths of the spectral lines.<break>
Here's a simple implementation:

This program calculates and prints the wavelengths of the spectral <break>
lines for the ***Lyman***, ***Balmer***, ***Paschen***, ***Bracket***, and ***Pfund*** series.<break>
Note that the wavelengths are calculated in meters <break>
and then converted to nanometers for easier reading.

- **Lyman**
- **Balmer**
- **Paschen**
- **Bracket**
- **Pfund**
